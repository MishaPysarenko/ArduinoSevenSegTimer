# Arduino Seven Segment Timer
The Arduino Seven Segment Timer project is a simple and efficient countdown timer built using an Arduino and a seven-segment display. It allows users to set a time interval, and the timer visually counts down to zero, making it ideal for various applications like cooking timers, study timers, or any situation where time tracking is needed.

# Key Features
- Customizable Time Intervals: Set time for countdown based on user input.
- Visual Display: Uses a seven-segment display for clear, real-time feedback.
- Arduino-Based: Built with an Arduino for easy customization and integration.

# Future Development
- Sound Alerts: Add buzzer for time-up notifications.
- Multiple Timer Presets: Enable users to store and select different countdown presets.
